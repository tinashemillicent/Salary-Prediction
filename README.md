# 💼 Salary Prediction 

This project aims to predict individual salaries based on a variety of demographic and professional attributes. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, we apply regression models to uncover how factors like experience, education, job title, and more influence earning potential.

## 📊 Problem Statement

In today's diverse and globalized workforce, understanding the relationship between salary and demographic/professional variables is crucial. This project explores salary prediction using features such as:

- Age
- Gender
- Education Level
- Job Title
- Country
- Race
- Years of Experience

By analyzing these factors, we aim to not only predict income levels but also understand patterns and disparities across different demographics.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns
- Train regression models to predict salaries based on relevant features
- Evaluate model performance and interpret key predictors of salary

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **Rows:** 6704 
- **Columns:** 9  
- **Target Variable:** Salary

The dataset includes a rich variety of features for analyzing income distribution and predictors of salary, with a focus on demographic and experience-based factors.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

Key insights from the data:

- **Years of Experience** is a strong predictor of salary.
- **Job Title** impacts earnings significantly — Data Scientists, Software Developers, and VP-level roles earn more.
- **Education Level** influences salary — Master's and Doctoral degrees are associated with higher incomes.
- Geographic and racial differences also influence income distribution.

## 🤖 Model Building & Evaluation

We applied regression models to predict salary values:

| Model                   | Accuracy |
|------------------------|----------|
| Decision Tree Regressor | 93.2%    |
| Random Forest Regressor | 94.6%    |

> 📌 The Random Forest Regressor outperformed other models and was able to capture complex patterns in the data with high accuracy.
